# ArfelRPG
A top down RPG, based on the GameDev.tv's online tutorials. 

The project is mostly playgrounds for me to test new stuff and/or showcase my knowledge.

The current goal is to make a few core systems which I'll use to hopefully create a short but impactful gameplay sequence in the likes of an MMOs first experience
where you're being introduced to the world and the game's mechanics, but not on a deep level.

I plan on having a playable version of this project on sokratisv.github.io/ArfelRPG/, but this obviously will change when/if the game can no longer be supported by WebGL/browsers.

Please feel free to send me any suggestions or feedback, whether good or bad.
